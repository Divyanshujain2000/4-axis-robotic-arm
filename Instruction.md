1.This contains the python code for sending serial data to a serial port which can be changed depending on the user.<br />
2.The microcontroller if atmega256 used the can be connected to usb via ISCP or usb to serial converter to tx rx.<br />
3. Else use Arduino mega directly.<br />
4. Folder contains Arduino IDE code as well as atmel studio convertion of the Arduino code.<br />
5. Arduino IDE code is used instead of directly coding in atmel studio to utilise inbuilt library for in Arduino ide for stepper motor.<br />
